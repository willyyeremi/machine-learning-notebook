# List of Limitations
## Categorical Handle
<ol>
    <li>one hot encoding: cannot differentiate between feature that can have null value and one that can't</li>
    <li>target encoding: script still not created</li>
</ol>

## Missing Value Handle
<ol>
    <li>still not deciding what the best method to fill the missing value</li>
</ol>

## Feature Engineering
<ol>
    <li>mutual information script has not been created</li>
    <li>categorical and missing value handler before dataset splitted for determining feature has not been created</li>
</ol>
