# Machine Learning Notebook
Simple machine learning utilizing Jupyter Notebook to hinder coding every time you need to create a machine learning model.

## Limitations of the notebook
### Categorical Handle
<ol>
    <li>one hot encoding: cannot differentiate between feature that can have null value and one that can't</li>
    <li>target encoding: script still not created</li>
</ol>

### Missing Value Handle
<ol>
    <li>still not deciding what the best method to fill the missing value</li>
</ol>

### Feature Engineering
<ol>
    <li>mutual information script has not been created</li>
    <li>k-cluster still not created</li>
    <li>chi-squared test for categorical still not created</li>
    <li>categorical and missing value handler before dataset splitted for determining feature has not been created</li>
    <li>data type changer not created</li>
</ol>

### Statistic Description
<ol>
    <li>statistic description not divided between numerical and categorical data</li>
    <li>skewness and kurtosis for continous feature still not created</li>
</ol>
